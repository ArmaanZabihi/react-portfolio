{/* PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Optician				2018 – 2019
Target Optical (Luxottica)									San Clemente, CA
Job Description: Provided support for patients who required assistance with training of contact lenses, usage of glasses. Adjusted frames, fixed broken glasses, and replaced lenses. Effective in attracting patients to the store, through cold approaches with free cleaners and coupons. Usage of computer programs to sell frames, sunglasses, protection plans from the Luxottica site or third party sellers. 
Key Accomplishments:
For the first 2-3 months of the job, my manager resigned. I operated the store whilst training myself until the district manager was able to find an employee to assist in operating the store with me. I worked longer than normal hours during this time, experienced grave pressure from the patients, and had little to no idea how to operate the store. Once the storm was calm, the district manager called me to congratulate me for my efforts and I was given a nice watch for my efforts of keeping the store running by myself with little to no experience. 
Contributed to the store with the highest protection plans sold. Was given a gift for the achievement.
